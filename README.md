2) Responses to the following questions:
• Other than to complete an assignment, what did you want to accomplish by creating this IF?

	I think it achieves what I wanted to because I did learn more cultural customs.

3) Beta testing
• Whose IF did you test?  What valuable feedback were you able to give them?
